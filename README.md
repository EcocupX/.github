# EcocupX
Ecocup is a cross-platform mobile application and web-app targeting to help reduce the escalating problem of single use plastics, which is leading towards an environmental disaster. Millions of animals are killed by plastics every year from birds to fish, and other marine organisms. Nearly 700 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by plastics - almost every species of seabirds eat plastics. 

Plastics that are properly captured and disposed through municipal solid waste systems pose minimal risk to ecosystems; however, plastics that enter ecosystems through mismanagement and “leakage” can pose physical and chemical hazards to wildlife.

Major efforts are taking place across the globe to address our single-use plastics problem and resulting ecological damage, many of them including governments reducing taxes on companies with low environmental footprint, huge campaigns taking place to raise public awareness and state-of-the-art technology being created in order to reduce ocean plastics.

With Ecocup we are providing a digital solution that will help companies decisevely reduce their environmental footprint, by producing less plastic waste as well as people receive benefits and rewards by using their re-usable (eco)cup.
