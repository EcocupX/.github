# Ecocup ♻️  
**Refill. Reward. Repeat.**: QR-powered reuse for cafés, chains, and communities. Track every refill, reward every habit, reduce single-use plastic at scale.

## Overview
Ecocup targets to reduce the escalating problem of single use plastics, which is leading towards an environmental disaster. Millions of animals are killed by plastics every year from birds to fish, and other marine organisms. Nearly 700 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by plastics - almost every species of seabirds eat plastics.

Plastics that are properly captured and disposed through municipal solid waste systems pose minimal risk to ecosystems; however, plastics that enter ecosystems through mismanagement and “leakage” can pose physical and chemical hazards to wildlife.

Major efforts are taking place across the globe to address our single-use plastics problem and resulting ecological damage, many of them including governments reducing taxes on companies with low environmental footprint, huge campaigns taking place to raise public awareness and state-of-the-art technology being created in order to reduce ocean plastics.

With Ecocup we are providing a digital solution that will help companies decisively reduce their environmental footprint, by producing less plastic waste as well as people receive benefits and rewards by using their re-usable (eco)cup.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Discover**: Users find **Ecocup-compatible** venues on the in-app map.
2. **Scan**: Each business displays a unique Ecocup QR. Users scan when refilling a reusable cup.
3. **Reward**: Stores configure perks (discounts, gifts, loyalty points). Users earn on every verified refill.
4. **Measure**: Dashboards show impact (e.g., plastic avoided, water and energy saved), supporting ESG and incentive programs.

## 🏪 For Businesses
- **Reduce costs & waste**: Fewer disposables, leaner operations.
- **Retention out of the box**: Loyalty tuned to refills, not receipts.
- **ESG & compliance**: Impact metrics for sustainability reports; supports tax-incentive narratives.
- **Frictionless rollout**: QR codes, role-based dashboards, multi-site support.
- **Marketing lift**: Verified impact you can share with customers and partners.

## Impact Metrics
Impact is calculated from verified refill events using conservative, published assumptions about avoided plastics and resource savings. Methodology notes, formulas, and data sources are documented in the analytics module so that partners, auditors, and regulators can validate results. Where local standards exist, Ecocup aligns with them and clearly flags any differences.

Methodologies are transparent and conservative; all formulas are documented in the analytics module.
