# Ecocup ♻️  
**Refill. Reward. Repeat.**: QR-powered reuse for cafés, chains, and communities. Track every refill, reward every habit, reduce single-use plastic at scale.

## 🌍 Overview
Ecocup is a cross-platform mobile and web platform designed to cut single-use plastic by turning refills into a measurable, rewarded behavior. Plastic that’s properly captured poses minimal risk; plastic that leaks into ecosystems harms wildlife and habitats. The world is mobilizing—policy incentives, public campaigns, and new technology—to reduce plastic waste. Ecocup adds the missing link: **proof-of-reuse** with real-time incentives and impact analytics.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Discover**: Users find **Ecocup-compatible** venues on the in-app map.
2. **Scan**: Each business displays a unique Ecocup QR. Users scan when refilling a reusable cup.
3. **Reward**: Stores configure perks (discounts, gifts, loyalty points). Users earn on every verified refill.
4. **Measure**: Dashboards show impact (e.g., plastic avoided, water and energy saved), supporting ESG and incentive programs.

## 🏪 For Businesses
- **Reduce costs & waste**: Fewer disposables, leaner operations.
- **Retention out of the box**: Loyalty tuned to refills, not receipts.
- **ESG & compliance**: Impact metrics for sustainability reports; supports tax-incentive narratives.
- **Frictionless rollout**: QR codes, role-based dashboards, multi-site support.
- **Marketing lift**: Verified impact you can share with customers and partners.

## 📊 Impact Metrics
Impact is calculated from verified refill events using conservative, published assumptions about avoided plastics and resource savings. Methodology notes, formulas, and data sources are documented in the analytics module so that partners, auditors, and regulators can validate results. Where local standards exist, Ecocup aligns with them and clearly flags any differences.

Methodologies are transparent and conservative; all formulas are documented in the analytics module.
