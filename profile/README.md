# Ecocup ♻️  
**Refill. Reward. Repeat.**: QR-powered reuse for cafés, chains, and communities. Track every refill, reward every habit, reduce single-use plastic at scale.

## 🌍 Overview
Ecocup is a cross-platform mobile and web platform designed to cut single-use plastic by turning refills into a measurable, rewarded behavior. Plastic that’s properly captured poses minimal risk; plastic that leaks into ecosystems harms wildlife and habitats. The world is mobilizing—policy incentives, public campaigns, and new technology—to reduce plastic waste. Ecocup adds the missing link: **proof-of-reuse** with real-time incentives and impact analytics.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Discover** — Users find **Ecocup-compatible** venues on the in-app map.  
2. **Scan** — Each business displays a unique Ecocup QR. Users scan when refilling a reusable cup.  
3. **Reward** — Stores configure perks (discounts, gifts, loyalty points). Users earn on every verified refill.  
4. **Measure** — Dashboards show impact (e.g., plastic avoided, water and energy saved), supporting ESG and incentive programs.

## 🏪 For Businesses
- **Reduce costs & waste**: Fewer disposables, leaner operations.  
- **Retention out of the box**: Loyalty tuned to refills, not receipts.  
- **ESG & compliance**: Impact metrics for sustainability reports; supports tax-incentive narratives.  
- **Frictionless rollout**: QR codes, role-based dashboards, multi-site support.  
- **Marketing lift**: Verified impact you can share with customers and partners.

## 👩‍💻 For Developers
- **API-first**: Clean, documented endpoints for auth, venues, scans, rewards, and impact stats.  
- **SDKs**: Mobile & web SDKs for rapid integration (scan, verify, reward).  
- **Extensible events**: Webhooks for CRM, POS, and marketing automation.  
- **Privacy by design**: Minimal data collection, anonymized analytics, opt-in features.
